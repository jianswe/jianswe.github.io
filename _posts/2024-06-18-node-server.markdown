# Introduction
## Node Overview 
sending the right data back requires using multiple features of the computer. 
- Network socket - Receive and send back messages over the internet.
- Filesystem - that's where the html/css/javascript code is stored in files.
- CPU - for cryptography and optimizing hashing passwords.
- Kernel - I/O management

Javascript doesn't have access to all of those, but C++ does. So Node.js is written in C++.
